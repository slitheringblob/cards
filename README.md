# Cards

**A dumb elx command line thing that deals the no of cards you want randomly.**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cards` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cards, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation has been generated to see if i can use exdoc. There are intentional bad doctests 
to show how both bad and good doctests look along with then being extremely helpful in doing automated
tests and assertions.
